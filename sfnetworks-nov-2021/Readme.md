## Spatial network analysis with the sfnetworks package

Renate Thiede talked to us about the {sfnetworks} package. The sfnetworks package combines the power of igraph (graphs) and sf (spatial data) to handle spatial networks such as road networks. This package facilitates the easy creation of spatial networks, both from manually-defined coordinates and from road network datasets; supports data cleaning; and possesses a wealth of network data manipulation and analysis techniques, including node clustering, route analysis and distance calculations. Easy conversion to sf also allows for sophisticated visualisation of analysis results in geographical space.
